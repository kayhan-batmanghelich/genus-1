# varbvs: large-scale Bayesian variable selection in MATLAB

The MATLAB interface has been tested extensively in MATLAB
version 8.6.0 (2015b).

### Setup

Begin by downloading the github repository for this project. The
simplest way to do this is to
[download the repository as a ZIP archive](http://github.com/pcarbo/varbvs/archive/master.zip). Once
you have extracted the files from the compressed archive, you will see
that the main directory contains two subdirectories, one containing
the MATLAB code, and the other containing the files for the R package.

Next, you will need to compile the C code into MATLAB executable
("MEX") files. To build the necessary MEX files, run the
[install.m](install.m) script in MATLAB. For the MEX
files to be built successfully, you will need to have a
[C compiler supported by MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/current_release/),
and you will need to configure MATLAB to build MEX files. See
[this webpage](http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html)
for more details.

When you take this step, it is important that you configure MATLAB so
that it uses the version of the C compiler that is compatible with
your version of MATLAB. Otherwise, you will encounter errors when
building the MEX files, or MATLAB may crash when attempting to run the
examples. If you run into these problems, you may have to run the mex
command with the -v flag to check what compiler is being used, and you
may have to edit the MEX configuration file manually.

Also note that the beginning of this script sets some compiler and
linker flags. These flags tell the GCC compiler to use the ISO C99
standard, and to optimize the code as much as possible. However, these
flags may not be relevant to your setup, especially if you are not
using [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org). Do not remove flag -DMATLAB_MEX_FILE;
this is important for correctly compiling the C code for MATLAB.

### Using the package

The main function of this package is the <code>varbvs</code> function,
which fits the variable selection model to data. In the
[demo_qtl.m](demo_qtl.m) script, for example, the varbvs function call
is simply

```MATLAB
fit = varbvs(X,Z,y,labels,[],struct('logodds',(-3:0.1:-1)));
```

In this example, we have used varbvs to map a quantitative trait
(*i.e.*, a continuously valued outcome) in a small, simulated data
set. Additionally, script [demo_cc.m](demo_cc.m) demonstrates mapping
of a binary valued outcome in a simulated data set.

We have provided a few other MATLAB scripts to demonstrate the
application of *varbvs* to very large data sets:
[demo_cd.m](demo_cd.m), [demo_celiac.m](demo_celiac.m) and
[demo_cytokine.m](demo_cytokine.m). Although we cannot share the data
needed to run these scripts due to data privacy restrictions, we have
included these scripts anyhow since it is helpful to be able to follow
the steps given in these MATLAB scripts. These scripts reproduce some
of the results and figures presented in Carbonetto *et al* (2016).
